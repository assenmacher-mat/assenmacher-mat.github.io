Hi there!

On this part of the page, I'm gonna share some information about my pathway through academia (up until now) and my research interests.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics from LMU in 2014, afterwards I turned to Statistics (with a focus on social and economic studies) and obtained my Master's degree in 2017 (also from LMU). Despite the "official" focus being on social and economic studis I developed great interest in medical applications, and most specifically in radio-epidemiological models which I also wrote my master thesis about (see: [thesis](https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/39110/) and [corresponding publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00411-019-00800-6))  
Shortly after starting to pursue my Ph.D. in April 2017, I stumbled across _Natural Language Processing_ (NLP) and decided to dig deeper into what now has become the main topic of my Ph.D. thesis. Since then, the whole field is moving with lightenig speed and I am having the pleasure to work on this topic in these exciting times.
I am especially interested in the (_fair_) comparability of large pre-trained language models (see [article @swisstext+konvens 2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2624/paper2.pdf)) as well as in their applicability to specific, challenging tasks (see [article @coling 2020](https://coling2020.org/) and more coming soon).

Besides doing research, I am also passionate about teaching. I am mostly teaching introductory courses in statistics (@LMU and elsewhere, see CV) as well as NLP related courses and seminars on M.Sc. level. 2020 was insofar a very nice year, since I was able to (co-)create some great resources: together with the students of our NLP seminar @LMU we published a small booklet, which contains the seminar papers of the students (check it out [here](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/seminar_nlp_ss20/))and together with some former colleagues we published an accompanying script with lots of explanations and examples for our introductory statistics course for economists (you can find it [here](https://github.com/assenmacher-mat/statwiwi)).
