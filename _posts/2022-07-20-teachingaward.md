This week, I received the Teaching Award for Non-Faculty Lecturers 2022 from the BWL Student Council Wasti. Besides being very happy about it, I see this award as an incentive to continue to put in a major effort into continuously improving my teaching in the future. Many thanks to all the students, to whom I owe this award!
