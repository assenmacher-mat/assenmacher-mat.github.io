---

Some pleasant news from the time during the Christmas holidays:  
The outcome of a project I worked on quite some time ago was published in the special Issue _Colorectal Liver Metastasis_ (Cancers).
The title of our work is "Prognostic Impact of Pedicle Clamping during Liver Resection for Colorectal Metastases" and it is openly available at [https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers130100729](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13010072).
