I will be attending ICAART 2021 in order to present out paper "_A new Benchmark for NLP in Social Sciences: Evaluating the usefulness of pre-trained language models for classifying open-ended survey responses_".  
The conference will be entirely online. For anyone interested in our work: I'm happy to get into a conversation during our presentation at [the poster session of Saturday (Feb 6)](https://www.insticc.org/node/TechnicalProgram/icaart/2021/presentationDetails/102551).
